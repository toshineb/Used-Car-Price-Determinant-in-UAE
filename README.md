# 🚗 Predicting Used Car Prices in the UAE with Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a data-driven exploration and predictive modeling of **used car prices in the UAE**, built using **Python, pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn** within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

The analysis involves **8,000+ real-world listings**, and uses structured machine learning workflows to identify **price trends**, uncover **influential features**, and build a predictive model to estimate resale value based on a car's specifications and condition.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> 💬 _"How can we predict the market value of a used car in the UAE based on mileage, brand, model, and other attributes?"_

Used cars make up a substantial portion of automotive transactions in the UAE. However, there’s little transparency in price expectations. This project uses machine learning to reduce this uncertainty for buyers, sellers, and dealerships alike.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Average used car price**: ~87,966 AED  
- **Top-priced models**: Ford GT (up to 4.75M AED), Shelby Cobra, Toyota Alphard  
- **Top car brands by volume**: Toyota (2,522), Nissan (2,125), Ford (1,216)  
- **Most influential features** (via Random Forest):
  - `Model_Encoded` (42.8%)
  - `Mileage` (29.6%)
  - `Production Year` (16.6%)

> 📈 R-squared score of the model: **0.63**, meaning it explains 63% of the price variance  
> 📊 Strong negative correlation between **Mileage** and **Price**  
> 📆 Newer cars, especially from premium brands, command the highest resale value
